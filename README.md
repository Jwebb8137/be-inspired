<p>I am a Full Stack Web Developer specializing in front and back-end technologies such as React, JS, Node, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, & more!</p>

<p>Describing the true passion I feel for coding and developing I feel like words alone don't do it much justice. Throughout life we all experience struggle and hardship, and usually tend to resort to a place where we can escape from it all and mentally find peace. Coding has, and continues to be, this utopia my mind can escape to and become enveloped in leaving the world as a whole behind. All that is left is just me and my code editor!</p>

<p>Mixing this deep desire to code with other passions (30 seconds looking at my portfolio one passion stands above the rest) I am constantly looking for opportunities or scenarios where technology could be used to solve a problem or improve a situation. This is one of many reasons I find such satisfaction and meaning in what I code and how it helps others.</p>

<p>Taking an enormous amount of pride and dedication in what I develop I am looking for the same passion and purpose in any future roles or opportunities I take.</p>
