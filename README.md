  <p>Aiming to create a social media platform geared towards promoting a positive and motivating experience Be-Inspired allows users to post and explore inspiring content uploaded by other users!</p>
  
## PERN Stack
<p>Be-Inspired was built using the PERN stack as the foundation of the application. The application includes JWT authentication for login and access, PostGres for storing and retrieving user uploads and posts, and all media is handled using Cloudinary's Upload Widget and Cloud storage. Designed with a desktop first approach the application includes a responsive design that looks great across all media platforms.</p>

## Additional Information
<p>This application was designed and developed as part of a full-stack project that required developing an application using the PERN stack. As my second full-stack project I decided to construct a social media platform that would allow me to gain valuable experience in the overall design and implementation of a more complex database / backend. Accomplishing just that I really enjoyed creating this application, giving me the opportunity to create something I am passionate about!</p>
